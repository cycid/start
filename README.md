Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

HI, this is my web site. I make it very simple without working in its design. Also i make a little mistake -  the main part of every page take table. Maybe it would be better do such sings via grid-view or Bootstrap. But for this site i think its not critical. Also i have here 3 links to css files: base css, bootstrap link, and stylesheet was converted from scss. Also in this dir are scss file, different images which i used in web site, and html pages. The main page is main.html :).
